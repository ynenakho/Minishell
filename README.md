# Minishell

First step of the realization of a shell. In this project, you need to make a mini-shell that reads and evaluates simple commands from the user. The reading will involve a trivial lexical and syntactical analysis of the command, and the evaluation will involve finding the corresponding binary on the machine and executing it, or executing the concerned code in the case of a "built-in" command to the shell.
